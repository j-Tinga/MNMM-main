Multinomial Mixture Model

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of my article on medium:
https://towardsdatascience.com/multinomial-mixture-model-for-supermarket-shoppers-segmentation-a-complete-tutorial-268974d905da

It contains the code to find the MLE parameter estimates of a multinomial mixture model using the expectation-maximization algorithm.
The algorithm is applied on a real world data found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/frtgnn/dunnhumby-the-complete-journey

Finally it contains additionnal notebooks for data exploration, model assessment, and analysis of the results.

Enjoy!
