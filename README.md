CS4103 Mini-Research: Multinomial Mixture Model

This mini-research aims to replicate the  https://github.com/biarne-a/MNMM using the following dataset
[https://towardsdatascience.com/multinomial-mixture-model-for-supermarket-shoppers-segmentation-a-complete-tutorial-268974d905da](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frtgnn/dunnhumby-the-complete-journey)

Replication of the codebase alongside the Model Selection and Analysis of the results for both Global and Individual MMM can be found at  [https://github.com/j-Tinga/MNMM-main/blob/main/Tinga.ipynb](Tinga.ipynb) 
Results of the can be downloaded at this Google Drive folder:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qPogvMUBiVAALVo6vbUm2_TBB8WZPnb4?usp=sharing
